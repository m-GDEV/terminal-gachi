## Purpose:

I am writing this to learn rust and have something fun in my terminal

## Detailed:

**This tamogachi will start out simple and become more complex**
Required Features:

-   Hunger: time since last command executes
-   Sleep: it will sleep on a random schedule during the day it should sleep in short 30-60 minute burst
-   Energy: number of command run
-   Levels: based on the number of commands run and age of the tamogachi it will level up over time
-   Small data structure, (in/de)crement values instead of storing continuous records
-   Moods: arbitrary moods that last 30-60 minutes
-   (could be based on weather)
-   Pet Characteristics: age, name, level, owner,personality (idk how i would make this relevant when actually interacting with it), favourite activities, skills, colour / breed, health)

## Steps/Order to complete project:

-   [x] Implement [se/de]serialization
-   [x] Parse command line options
-   [x] Separate all functions into modules
-   [ ] Create new files and write functions for the tamogachi modifiers
-   [ ] Implement dynamic logic (leveling up, sleep state, etc)
-   [ ] Figure out if you want to use health and energy
-   [ ] Test with starship

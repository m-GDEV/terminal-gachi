This file is not meant to ever be used, but rather to define the
data and structure of it in a json format.

This tamogachi will start out simple and become more complex.
As such I will include certain fields in the data structure
that will not be used initially but may be used in the future.

Required Features:
- Hunger: time since last command executes
- Sleep: because implementing a time-based sleep is hard I will make sleep
something that occurs randomly and then lasts for X invocations of the program.
sleep_left should be reset every time the program determines it should be sleeping.
then, on every invocation if sleeping == true decrement sleep_left by one
- Energy: number of commands run. the commandsRunPerDay tracks how many times
the program has been invoked per day. energy = 0 at 0 invocations and slowly
rises up with 1000 invocations being max energy
- Levels: based on the number of commands run and age of the tamogachi
it will level up over time
- Small data structure, (in/de)crement values instead of storing continuous records
- Moods: arbitrary moods that last 30-60 minutes (could be based on weather)
- Pet Characteristics:  age, name, level, owner,
personality (idk how i would make this relevant
    when actually interacting with it),
    favourite activities,
    skills,
    colour / breed,
    health

    Here is the data structure:

    {
        "name": "Yoshi",
        "age": 23,
        "level": 0,
        "owner": "Mario",
        "personality": "energetic",
        "colour": "green",
        "breed": "dinosaur",
        "health": "great shape",
        "hunger": 0,
        "sleeping": false,
        "sleep_left": 0,
        "energy": 0,
        "commands_run_per_day": [
            {
                "day": "19122023",
                "commands_run": 0
            }
        ]
    }
